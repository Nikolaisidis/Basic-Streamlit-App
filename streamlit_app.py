                I was born in Cebu City, Philippines. I only have one sibling, which is my sister. I remember that when I was a child, I tended to worry a lot to the point where my heart would beat so fast because I would create fake scenarios in my mind. One example I remember is when my marble fell into the basin of our neighbor while she was washing clothes. I worried that it might get picked up by her child and swallowed. When I reached the age of 6-7 years old, while playing hide and seek with my friends, I suddenly looked up at the sky and asked if someone superior really exists. This moment was a turning point for me and had a significant impact on how I think today.

    As a student, I wanted to build an application that could help the community. During our appdev in 3rd year, my co-members created an app called Palit where it can help local vendors sell their goods to nearby customers. It is kind of inspired by Angkas and Grabfood but we wanted it for more convenience so we used geo-location to detect nearby customers and deliver the goods immediately.
